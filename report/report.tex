        The use of convolutional neural networks (CNN) for computer vision problems has been significantly successful. 
        However, there is still a debate whether a complex non-linear model can outperform linear models for brain imaging data. 
        In this project, we examine how each component of CNN contributes to the overall performance of the model in predicting brain image-derived phenotypes(IDPs). 
        We found that kernel size, strides number and deeper network have profound effects on the performance especially in gray-white contrast related phenotypes.
